  <p>The Law of Success is a book written by Napoleon Hill in 1925.<br>

It was originally released as a set of 15 separate booklets before being consolidated into a single-tome book.<br>
 There were 118 limited edition copies, which were given to many of America's most successful individuals, all of whom had contributed to the content of the book. <br>
 Orne Publishing used one of these original copies to create a reprinted version of The Law of Success in 2010.  <img src="2bk.jpg" width="180" height="180">
