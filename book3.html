    <h1 align="left">THE LAW OF SUCCESS (ORANGE BOOK),by Napolean Hill</h1>
  <p> Napoleon Hill was an American author in the area of the new thought movement who was one of the earliest producers of the modern genre of personal-success literature.<br>
     He is widely considered to be one of the great writers on success.<br>
      His most famous work, Think and Grow Rich (1937), is one of the best-selling books of all time (at the time of Hill's death in 1970, Think and Grow Rich had sold 20 million copies).<br>
       Hill's works examined the power of personal beliefs, and the role they play in personal success.<br>
     He became an advisor to President Franklin D. Roosevelt from 1933 to 1936.<br>
     "What the mind of man can conceive and believe, it can achieve" is one of Hill's hallmark expressions.<br>
      How achievement actually occurs, and a formula for it that puts success in reach of the average person, were the focal points of Hill's books.
