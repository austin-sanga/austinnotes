    <h1 align="left">SPRINT,Jake Knapp</h1>
  <p>The big idea with the Design Sprint is to build and test a prototype in just five days.
     You'll take a small team, clear the schedule for a week, and rapidly progress from problem to tested solution using a proven step-by-step checklist.<br>

A Design Sprint is like fast-forwarding into the future, so you can see how customers react before you invest all the time and expense of creating your new product, service, marketing campaign... or whatever!<br>

But the Design Sprint is not just about efficiency.
 It's also an excellent way to stop the old defaults of office work and replace them with a smarter, more respectful, and more effective way of solving problems that brings out the best contributions of everyone on the team and helps you spend your time on work that really matters.  <img src="8bk.jpg" width="200" height="200">
